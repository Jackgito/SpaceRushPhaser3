## HTML5 Game - Space Rush

This project is a 2D-sidescrolling game developed using Phaser 3 framework for web browsers. 
The game challenges players to navigate a spaceship through an asteroid field, aiming to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score. 
The intensity of the game increases over time, providing an engaging experience for players.

The game has been tested on multiple browsers, but it doesn't work well with mobile devices.
